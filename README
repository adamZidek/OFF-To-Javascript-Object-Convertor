Welcome to Adam Zidek's Off File to Javascript Program!

To build the program, I have included a makefile!
    Simply type make and an executable will be created!

This Program uses command lin arguments to run, which include the following:

-modelName 'arbitrary name'         //This will assign the model name to the user entered name
                                    //If no name is entered, the default value of 'CubeModel' will be given.
                                    
To pipe input and output files to the program, use the default < and > to direct data.

If no pipes are used, the program will default to regular cin and cout streams.

An example run of the program will show as follows:
    ./off2js -modelName CubeModel < cube.off > cube.js
    
For this to work, the file 'cube.off' must exist. Cube.js will be created afer execution.

A few steps went into accomplishing the scaling of the model.

First I had to calculate the minimum value of the x, y, and z coordinates. These min values then get inverted, and added to each x, y, and z.
                    For all points x, y, and z
                        Xn = Xn + -minX
                        Yn = Yn + -minY
                        Zn = Zn + -minZ

This is done so that the smallest value of x, y, and z will be 0. 

The max of all coordinate values is then calculated, it is important that this is done after adding the inverted min. Once the max is calcuated, each x, y, z is divided by this max value. 

                    For all porints x, y, and z
                        Xn = Xn / MAX
                        Yn = Yn / MAX
                        Zn = Zn / MAX

This simply scales the model down by the largest dimension.

Finally, .5 should be subtracted by each x, y, and z coordinate. Prior to subtracting .5, the coordinates are between 0 and 1, subtracting this value puts the values between -.5, and .5. This results in a properly scaled model.
